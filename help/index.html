			<h2>About uBillboard</h2>
			<p>Thank you for purchasing uBillboard! Your continued support helps us maintain this product.
			So roughly on its first birthday we're coming with the third major revision!</p>
			<p>uBillboard was one of the first Slider/Billboard-type Premium Plugins for WordPress on 
			CodeCanyon. It enjoys continued popularity for nearly a year now, mainly because of the ease
			of use and feature set, that is wide and yet does not ovewhelm you, like some other products,
			with options you'll never need. Our featureset is based on what our users have been really 
			requesting over the course of uBillboard's lifetime.</p>

		<div id="support">
			<h2>Support</h2>
			<p>Most of the possible issues will be covered this doc, or you can take a look
			inside the Help drawer on any uBillboard page in WordPress Admin for help with that particular
			page. If, however, you are unable to solve the issue by reading documentation, or if
			you believe that you've found a bug, feel free to contact us.</p>
			<p>Steps to follow if you have found a problem:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Check this Help, especially the F.A.Q.</li>
				<li>Check the contextual help in uBillboard WP Admin</li>
				<li>Check the F.A.Q. <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/ubillboard-premium-slider-for-wordpress/faq/124783">here</a></li>
				<li>If none of these has helps, contact us <a href="http://codecanyon.net/user/uDesignStudios">here</a></li>
			</ol>
			<p>We include this order, because most of the problems are easily solved and are disucssed in the
			docs, so you are wasting your own time waiting for us to respond.</p>
			<p>If you are going to contact us, include the URL where the problem can be seen and consider
			giving us the WP login credentials also (you can create a new administrator account for us

		<div id="installation">
			<h2>Installation</h2>
			<p>uBillboard installation should be pretty straightforward. You have downloaded a ZIP file containing 
			this help and another ZIP file, called uBillboard.zip. We will assume you have WordPress installed
			already (if not, read <ha ref="http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress">here</a>).</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In your	WordPress Admin go to Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; Upload</li>
				<li>Select uBillboard.zip and press Install Now</li>
				<li>If it is not already, go to Plugins and press Activate on the uBillboard line</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After installation you may want to check if the cache folder has the right permissions. To do that
			open your WordPress installation using your FTP program and go to wp-content/plugins/uBillboard. Check
			if the permissions on the cache directory are sufficient (777, or 755 on some hosts)</p>

			<p>The envisioned mode of operation is that you first go to uBillboard &gt; Add New, create your
			billboard and then just add the corresponding shortcode in the Page or Post of your liking. We've
			done maximum to simplify this process for you.</p>
			<p>When you first open the Add New page in the uBillboard menu, you will be presented with a line,
			already containing an unique name for your new Billboard, a box that represents the first slide, 
			and some more boxes on the right hand side for options.</p>
