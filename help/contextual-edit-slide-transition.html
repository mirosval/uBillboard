<h4>Transitions</h4>
<dl>
	<dt>Transition Delay:</dt>
	<dd>If Autoplay is active or the user has started the playback manually, this value will determine how much time will pass before
	the next slide is animated in.</dd>
	
	<dt>Transition:</dt>
	<dd>Allows you to select an effect that will be applied when switching from the next slide</dd>
	
	<dt>Transition Direction:</dt>
	<dd>The mode of application of the transition effect. The combination of these two settings determines how will the transition look.
	There are some combinations that don't make sense and therefore are not implemented. These will fall back to a default transition
	direction for the selected transition.</dd>
