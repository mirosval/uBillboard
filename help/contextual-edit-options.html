<h4>uBillboard Options</h4>
<dl>
	<dt>Title</dt>
	<dd>Allows you to assing a name for your uBillboard, in case you have multiple. It is recommended to use the default name though.</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Preview</dt>
	<dd>Allows you to preview the billboard. Will save your changes into a temporary billboard, so you need to make sure you save your
	changes using the "Save uBillboard" button. This preview also does not necessarily have to look exactly the same as in the frontend.
	This is because Preview does not load your theme's CSS, and therefore it will not reflect on this previewed uBillboard.</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Show Advanced Options</dt>
	<dd>Some options allow you detailed configuration, which is not required in most cases. You can enable this option to show these advanced
	items in all the panels.</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Width</dt>
	<dd>Specifies uBillboard width in pixels. This width represents the width of the actual stage area, where all the slides are. If you have
	either thumbnails or controls set to "outside", the actual total space taken by uBillboard will be more. If "Apply Automatic Resizing"
	is enabled, images will be resized to fit this width.</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Height</dt>
	<dd>Specifies uBillboard height in pixels, generally the same rules apply as to Width.</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Shuffle Slides</dt>
	<dd>Will randomize the order in which slides appear on each page load.</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Autoplay</dt>
	<dd>Will automatically start playing once all slides have been loaded.</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Square Size</dt>
	<dd>Some of the animations are based around relatively small squares that are animated separately to achieve beautiful transition.
	You can control the dimension (in pixels) of these squares using this option. Please note: The smaller the dimension, the smaller the squares.
	The smaller the squares, the more of them are needed to fill the uBillboard space. Too many squares can cause performance issues,
	general rule of thumb with this option is to keep it on a value that, given your uBillboard Width and Height will generate 50 - 100
	squares. [50 &gt; (width / square size) * (height / square size) &gt; 100]</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Style</dt>
	<dd>Optional, it is the default style for your content boxes with slide descriptions if you have any. These can be then overriden
	with the per-description box options in the Content Editor</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Delete</dt>
	<dd>Deletes this uBillboard. Not undoable.</dd>
	
	<dt>Options - Save uBillboard</dt>
	<dd>Saves uBillboard overwriting any uBillboards with the same name.</dd>
