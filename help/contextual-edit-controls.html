<h4>Slide Order</h4>
<dl>
	<dt>Slide Order</dt>
	<dd>Each box represents a slide. Drag them around, when you drop, slides on the left will be automatically moved/renamed. You still
	need to save uBillboard for the changes to take effect on the frontend.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Controls</h4>
<dl>
	<dt>Show Timer</dt>
	<dd>Will show a countdown circle in the top right corner of the slide that will show the time remaining before the next slide is
	shown. This will not appear if you don't have Autoplay enabled or don't press Play. This feature is not supported on browsers 
	that don't support Canvas - that is the IE.</dd>
	
	<dt>Controls Skin</dt>
	<dd>Allows you to choose the skin you want to use with your uBillboard instance. There is a variety of skins with different
	controls layouts and behaviors as well as look &amp; feel</dd>
	
	<dt>Controls Position</dt>
	<dd>Controls can be positioned either inside of the uBillboard bounds defined by Width and Height options, or outside. Generally
	where exactly are they positioned is controlled by the Controls Skin, but you can decide if you want them covering your content.
	The controls position is useful when your controls overlap with Thumbnails. In that case you can position either the controls,
	or thumbnails outside or inside so that the two don't overlap.</dd>
	
	<dt>Show Controls</dt>
	<dd>This option controls the display of Next/Prev buttons. You can either show them at all times, on mouse hover over uBillboard,
	or never.</dd>
	
	<dt>Show Play/Pause</dt>
	<dd>Similar to "Show Controls", but controls the Play/Pause button.</dd>
	
	<dt>Show Paginator</dt>
	<dd>Similar to "Show Controls" and "Show Play/Pause", but controls the paginator. Paginator is most of the time displayed as
	bullets that each represent the corresponding slide, but in some skins in can take other forms.</dd>
	
	<dt>Show Thumbnails</dt>
	<dd>Similar to "Show Controls" etc. Thumbnails are small images that represent the content of the slide they point to. When
	you click a thumbnail, you will be taken to the corresponding slide.</dd>
	
	<dt>Thumbnails Position</dt>
	<dd>Thumbnails can be positioned on all four edges of uBillboard.</dd>
	
	<dt>Thumbnails Inside</dt>
	<dd>Similar to Controls Position, thumbnails can be positioned inside or outside.</dd>
	
	<dt>Thumbnail Width</dt>
	<dd>Width if the thumbnail image in pixels</dd>
	
	<dt>Thumbnail Height</dt>
	<dd>Height if the thumbnail image in pixels</dd>
	
	<dt>Thumbnail Hover Color</dt>
	<dd>The border color of each thumbnail</dd>
